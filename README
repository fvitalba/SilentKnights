Silent Knights is a scrolling 2D RPG, where you become a Knight.
Your Duty is to bring peace over the land of Fedia, which is bei
ng controlled by a mighty witch called Paurina. 

Her skills in black Magic have developed quickly when she was a 
child. Her mother, a well-respected Mage herself, taught Paurina
everything she knew, but did tell her to never make use of the B
lack Magic, as it's powers were unstable and not comprehensable 
for the mortals. Paurina's Father though, was an old lumberjack 
and always lived in the shadow of his wife. 
The Family lived in the tranquil woods of Fedia, the huge amount
of tree's secured the lumberjack's work. On the other hand, Paur
ina's Mother often had to stay in the City Hope for the night, w
hen she was working hard. So the little magician had to stay at 
home most of the time, without her mother or her father, both at
work. Nothing else to do, Paurina decided to do, what nobody els
e she knew did before, check out the deeps of the Forest. Lookin
g for mystic and interesting things to discover, Paurina stumble
s accross a silver shining lake. As she walks to the lakeshore, 
she hears an elven chorus singing. The sound is simply stunning 
and all together with the sight Paurina completely forgets the t
ime. Hours pass and she find's herself in a daydream about black
magic. The little girl, completely muzzy starts to comprehend th
e words written on a dark papyrus with some kind of 'red ink'. P
aurina reads out loud the spell and suddenly the beautiful silve
r lake turns into a deep source of pain filled with blood. She h
ears screams and crys from the other side, which is hidden by fo
g. Paurina panics and tries to run away in fear. It's already la
te in the evening when the girl arrives home to her worried pare
nts. Her mother, full in fear of loosing her little sunshine, hu
gs the kid as tight as never before. It's a hearthtaking moment,
but the father just stands there, trying to hide his tears. Afte
r all, he loved his little girl.
