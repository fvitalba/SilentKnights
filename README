Silent Knights is a scrolling 2D RPG, where you become a Knight.
Your Duty is to bring peace over the land of Fedia, which is bei
ng controlled by a mighty witch called Paurina. 

Her skills in black Magic have developed quickly when she was a 
child. Her mother, a well-respected Mage herself, taught Paurina
everything she knew, but did tell her to never make use of the B
lack Magic, as it's powers were unstable and not comprehensable 
for the mortals. Paurina's Father though, was an old lumberjack 
and always lived in the shadow of his wife. 
The Family lived in the tranquil woods of Fedia, the huge amount
of tree's secured the lumberjack's work. On the other hand, Paur
ina's Mother often had to stay in the City Hope for the night, w
hen she was working hard. So the little magician had to stay at 
home most of the time, without her mother or her father, both at
work. Nothing else to do, Paurina decided to do, what nobody els
e she knew did before, check out the deeps of the Forest. Lookin
g for mystic and interesting things to discover, Paurina stumble	!
s accross a silver shining lake. As she walks to the lakeshore, 
she hears an elven chorus singing. The sound is simply stunning 
and all together with the sight Paurina completely forgets the t
ime. Hours pass and she find's herself in a daydream about black
magic. The little girl, completely muzzy starts to comprehend th
e words written on a dark papyrus with some kind of 'red ink'. P
aurina reads out loud the spell and suddenly the beautiful silve
r lake turns into a deep source of pain filled with blood. She h
ears screams and crys from the other side, which is hidden by fo
g. Paurina panics and tries to run away in fear. It's already la
te in the evening when the girl arrives home to her worried pare
nts. Her mother, full in fear of loosing her little sunshine, hu
gs the kid as tight as never before. It's a hearthtaking moment,
but the father just stands there, trying to hide his tears. Afte
r all, he loved his little girl.
This is where Paurina was never the same again. She always tried
to be the best amongst other, she wanted to forget what she hear
d. Since she could hardly sleep anymore she used the time in the
night to read in old books from her mother's shelf. Paurina find
s herself accumulating more and more magic knowledge and so she 
decides to drop out of her university to become a magician like 
her mother. Her Father though has other plans for his precious c
hild. He does not want to loose his Paurina, but her Mother is t
oo proud of Paurina to see her husbands fear of loosing his only
child. Paurina's father gets constantly congratulated in town as
soon as the message is spread across the land. He recognizes tha
t he has no other chance to convince Paurina of staying in unive
rsity to get a degree and living a calm and tranquil life, so he
r Father decides to take his daughters destiny in his own hands.
	Paurina's Father goes to seek for a powerful witch who lives
in the forest. He found her one day when he was chopping some tr
ee's and came to this strange house made of something that smell
ed like cheese but looked like wood. While the witch had nothing
to worry about since he was just a normal Lumberjack, she still 
decided to give him a chance and to sign a contract. They both d
eclared that nobody was harming the other in any way. Since Paur
ina's father thought this to be the only solution, he went to me
et the witch in the woods. Eventually he found the cheese-smelli
ng house and had a talk to the witch. He asked for a curse to ma
ke Paurina forget about the career as a magician and instead con
tinued to go to university.
The witch brew some stew and gave it to the father with the word
s "be careful! For what you wish, may not always be what you act
ually want.". The Lumberjack however, did not wast a single thou
ght on the witch's last words before leaving and headed home.
